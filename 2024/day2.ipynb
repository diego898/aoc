I assumed it was safe until that point - so only removing the failure point and forward needed to be checked. In our example, it would mean we failed at 9, and then just needed to check `[8, 8, 6]` - which would fail, making this sequence unsafe. This is incorrect.\n",

I should have considered the **pair** and checked if the removal of the left point and then the right point before passing or failing the sequence. This would have let me also catch the skipping the first element issue.\n",
